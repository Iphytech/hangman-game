# hangman-game

## Rule

You can check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) for the rules of Hangman.

## Requirements

Let's build an animal theme Hangman game.

Use this array of animal as starting point (or create one yourself, that'd be cool too).

```
["dog", "cat", "cow", "sheep", "bird", "fish", "horse", "lion", "tiger"]
```

- Click start button --> create a new game with a randomly selected word from this array
- The game listen to player keyboard for guesses (player clicks "a" === player guesses the letter "a")
- Keep track of `misses` (6 `misses` === die)
- If the player successfully guesses the word === +1 `point`; the game shows the next word to play
- When the player dies --> Show how many points (the number of words they have guessed) + a Restart button

**Note**: This is just a basic suggestion. Few free to be creative and make this as awesome as you can.

I'm excited to see what you can come up with!!
